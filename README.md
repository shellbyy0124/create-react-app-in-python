Create A React App In Python


I know the title can be misleading, however, this script is meant to
assist in automating the users workspace just a little bit further. I've
left this script 100% FOSS and un-licensed for anyone to use how they please. 

This script was built with a specific file structure, however, you're welcome to
edit the paths as needed and same for the dependencies. I left this as an open-ended
script to allow the user to customer their directories for their workspace, and 
allow them to insert/remove any dependencies that they may need for the newly created
project.
